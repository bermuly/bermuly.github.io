It was invented in 2004 by blogger John Gruber and Internet activist Aaron Schwartz to quickly format articles. As a result, they have a simple language that is still actively used.\nThe point of the markdown is that you make the markup of your document with minimal effort, and already some other plugin or program turns your markup into a final document - for example, HTML. But it is possible not in HTML, but in PDF or something else. Markdown is like a language for other programs to form documents based on your text.\nThe only thing you may need is to adjust fonts, margins and colors in this plugin to make the result look beautiful. You set it up once, and then you quickly write a lot of materials that will turn into ready-made articles with good markup at the output.\nRise and divergence As Markdowns popularity grew rapidly, many Markdown implementations appeared, driven mostly by the need for additional features such as tables, footnotes, definition lists, and Markdown inside HTML blocks.\nThe behavior of some of these diverged from the reference implementation, as Markdown was only characterised by an informal specification and a Perl implementation for conversion to HTML.\nAt the same time, a number of ambiguities in the informal specification had attracted attention. These issues spurred the creation of tools such as Babel mark to compare the output of various implementations, and an effort by some developers of Markdown parsers for standardisation. However, Gruber has argued that complete standardization would be a mistake: “Different sites (and people) have different needs. No one syntax would make all happy.”\nWhy is this necessary?   To add markup to places where real markup is not possible. For example, in a simple text file or in the same SMS, where it is impossible to highlight bold, create titles, highlight quotes, etc.\n  For more convenient writing of texts for subsequent conversion to HTML or other formats.\n  Conclusions As you can see, Markdown, despite the fact that it is more than a decade old, is still a popular text markup language. Its simplicity and economy wins the hearts of more and more new users who find various non-trivial uses for it\n","date":1652530237,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652530237,"objectID":"bd238f54b82fdcd586f8f7e438599565","permalink":"https://example.com/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2022-05-14T15:10:37+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"What is Markdown and why is it needed?","tags":["markdown"],"title":"Markdown","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zheldakova Viktoria"],"categories":[],"content":"The past week has been quite stressful, but I’ve coped because I really like what I’m doing.\n All laboratory work was completed on time I didn’t go to the gym because of a busy schedule Did you manage to take a walk with friends   I think I spent this week quite productively and I hope that next week everything will be the same.\n","date":1652530205,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652530205,"objectID":"8a35701d7ac0a4bc50429e19964d4a10","permalink":"https://example.com/post/last-week_2/","publishdate":"2022-05-14T15:10:05+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/last-week_2/","section":"post","summary":"How I spent last week","tags":["diary"],"title":"Last Week 2","type":"post"},{"authors":["Viktoria Zheldakova"],"categories":[],"content":"   In programming, the version control system is responsible for saving code at checkpoints — a special technology that can be connected to any project. The version control system insures against errors and returns the code to the state when everything worked.\nA Brief history of Git Like many things in life, Git started with a bit of creative chaos and heated arguments.\nThe Linux kernel is a fairly large open source project. For most of the Linux kernel development time (1991-2002), changes were passed between developers in the form of patches and archives. In 2002, the Linux kernel project started using the proprietary decentralized BitKeeper SCR.\nIn 2005, the relationship between the Linux kernel development community and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper ceased, and free use of the utility became impossible. This prompted the Linux kernel development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own utility, taking into account the lessons learned while working with BitKeeper. Some of the goals pursued by the new system were:\n Speed Simple architecture Good support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches) Full decentralization  The ability to effectively manage large projects, such as the Linux kernel (speed and reasonable use of disk space) Since its introduction in 2005, Git has evolved into an easy-to-use system while retaining its original qualities. It is surprisingly fast, efficient in working with large projects and has an excellent branch system for non-linear development.\nGit is a distributed version system Version control systems can be local, centralized, or distributed.\nA local system stores files on a single device, a centralized system uses a shared server, and a distributed system uses shared cloud storage and local devices of team members. It is convenient to work with large projects in a local system, but it is difficult to interact with a remote team.\nIn a centralized system, remote work is established, but everything is tied to one server. Any failure or hacking can damage the project files.\nRemote work is established in the distributed system. If something happens to the files of the main repository, it is easy to restore the project from a copy of any team member.\nGit is not GitHub Git is a program that needs to be installed and connected to a project to manage a version control system. GitHub is a repository site for project version histories: you connect Git, register on GitHub, create an online repository and transfer files from Git to GitHub.\nGit is the most popular version control system, and GitHub is an online code repository. Git and GitHub are configured to interact and therefore are often used as a single mechanism for working with a project.\nWhy would a beginner learn Git Git is used in most companies where at least two developers work on the project:\n A new person comes to the company and clones the project repository on a PC. Gets a task, creates a new branch and writes code. When everything is ready, it sends a request to add code to the master branch. Other developers look at the code, leave comments and point out errors. The beginner completes the code, updates the master branch and moves on to the next task.
